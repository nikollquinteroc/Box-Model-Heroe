# Box-Model-Heroes
Provided by: Digital House - Frontend I- layout

Objective:
One of the main tasks of a Front End developer is both structuring interfaces and styling interfaces and apply styles from a wireframe or an image. The challenge will be to recognize the different tags and the corresponding styles that could make up the layout and design to start  structuring a file until a visual result similar to the reference is obtained.

Challenge:
Using the design developed in Figma, available at the following https://www.figma.com/file/MGgSvEcOH98dr3J4CJBXq7/CLASE-10?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design&t=8LjI6Erctp0fRLLj-0, the idea will be to review the different elements and styles that correspond to that visual output and layout it.
